# Guess the Number!

This is a silly game I made one day when I was bored. You just have to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100 in 6 tries. I just like to use binary search to try and find the number, but I intentionally gave 6 guesses because it takes 7 guesses to search 100 numbers, so it still comes down to a 50/50 guess with that method. It's a silly time-waster with some slight amusement.

Open the HTML file in a web browser to play the game.

Type your guess and click submit. It'll tell you if your guess is too high or too low. The game also keeps track of your win-streak; exciting!
